Join pushdown
"""""""""""""

The ``join-pushdown.enabled`` catalog configuration property or
``join_pushdown_enabled`` :ref:`catalog session property
<session-properties-definition>` control whether the connector pushes down join
operations. The property defaults to ``false`` to provide an effective measure
against higher compute costs for some connectors. Enabling join pushdowns may
negatively impact performance for some queries.
